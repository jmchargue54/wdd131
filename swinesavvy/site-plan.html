			<h2>Basic Care</h2>
			<h4>Shelter</h4>
			<p>Ensure your pigs have a clean, dry, and well-ventilated shelter. It should protect them from extreme weather conditions, whether hot, cold, or rainy. You can also inlucde some kind of mud or water pit so they can cool off and prevent sundburns during hot weather. Use clean, dry bedding such as straw or shavings. Regularly clean and replace bedding to prevent the buildup of waste and bacteria. Provide adequate space for your pigs to move around. Overcrowding can lead to stress and health issues.</p>
			<h4>Food</h4>
			<p>Feed your pigs a balanced diet formulated specifically for show pigs. This typically includes a mix of grains, protein, vitamins, and minerals. Establish a consistent feeding schedule, feeding your pigs twice a day. Ensure they have access to fresh, clean water at all times. Regularly monitor your pig's weight and adjust their diet as needed to ensure they are gaining weight appropriately for the show.</p>
			<h4>Health Care</h4>
			<p>Keep your pigs up-to-date on vaccinations and deworming. Consult with a veterinarian to establish a health care plan. Regular Check-ups: Regularly check your pigs for signs of illness or injury. Common signs include coughing, loss of appetite, and changes in behavior.</p>
			<h4>Training</h4>
			<p>Start training your pigs early. Teach them to walk with a whip, respond to commands, and stay calm around people. Handle your pigs gently and consistently to build trust and reduce stress. Spend time with them daily to get them used to human interaction. Practice showing your pigs in a ring-like environment to get them accustomed to the sights and sounds of the show.</p>
			<h4>Record Keeping</h4>
			<p>Keep detailed records of your pigs' diet, weight, health care, and training progress. This helps you track their development and make informed decisions. Familiarize yourself with the specific requirements and rules of the show you will be participating in. Ensure you meet all the criteria well in advance.</p>
